## üß™ Pre-Production Testing Checklist

### 1. Product Display Testing

#### Products WITH Multiple Sizes
- [ ] Size selector appears on product cards
- [ ] Size selector appears on product details page
- [ ] All available sizes are displayed

### 3. Shopping Cart Testing

#### Quantity Adjustments
- [ ] Increase quantity button works for items with sizes
- [ ] Decrease quantity button works for items with sizes
- [ ] Manual quantity input works
- [ ] Removing item removes correct size variant only

### 4. Checkout Testing

#### Cart Save Operations
- [ ] Cart saves to backend with sizes included
- [ ] Check browser console: payload includes "size" field
- [ ] Backend accepts cart creation request
- [ ] Backend accepts cart update request

#### Order Creation
- [ ] Order is created successfully
- [ ] OrderLines include size information
- [ ] Check backend: Order data shows sizes
- [ ] Order confirmation displays sizes

### 5. Error Handling Testing

#### Server Validation Errors
- [ ] Backend rejects missing size ‚Üí User sees friendly error
- [ ] Backend rejects invalid size ‚Üí User sees friendly error
- [ ] 400 errors show appropriate message
- [ ] 403 errors show "Please log in" message
- [ ] 404 errors show "Product not found" message

#### Network Errors
- [ ] Disconnect from internet
- [ ] Try to add to cart
- [ ] User sees "Unable to connect to server" message

### 6. Data Persistence Testing

#### LocalStorage
- [ ] Cart items with sizes persist after page reload
- [ ] Size information is retained in localStorage
- [ ] Multiple size variants persist correctly

#### Backend Sync
- [ ] Cart auto-saves to backend (check console logs)
- [ ] Size information is sent to backend
- [ ] Cart can be retrieved with sizes intact

### 7. Accessibility Testing

#### Keyboard Navigation
- [ ] Tab key navigates through size buttons
- [ ] Enter/Space key selects a size
- [ ] Focus indicator is visible

#### Screen Reader

- [ ] Error messages are announced

### 8. Cross-Browser Testing

- [ ] Safari: All features work
- [ ] Edge: All features work

### 9. Mobile Responsive Testing

- [ ] Size selector is usable on mobile
- [ ] Size buttons are large enough to tap
- [ ] Error messages are readable
- [ ] Cart display shows sizes properly

### 10. API Integration Testing

#### Backend Endpoints
- [ ] POST `/api/cart/create` accepts size field
- [ ] PUT `/api/cart/update` accepts size field
- [ ] POST `/api/order/create` accepts size in orderLines
- [ ] GET `/api/products/getall` returns sizes array

#### Payload Validation
Check browser Network tab for these payloads:

**Cart Create:**
```json
{
  "customer": { "customerId": 1 },
  "items": [{ "productId": 5, "quantity": 1, "size": "3-6M" }],
  "checkedOut": false
}
```

**Cart Update:**
```json
{
  "cartId": 12,
  "customerId": 1,
  "items": [{ "productId": 5, "quantity": 2, "size": "6-12M" }]
}
```

**Order Create:**
```json
{
  "customerId": 1,
  "orderLines": [
    {
      "productId": 5,
      "quantity": 1,
      "unitPrice": 299.99,
      "subTotal": 299.99,
      "size": "3-6M"
    }
  ]
}
```

## üîß Debug Mode Checklist

### Console Logs to Monitor
Enable these console statements for debugging:

1. **Adding to Cart:**
   ```
   "Adding to cart: { id, name, size }"
   ```

2. **Saving Cart:**
   ```
   "üíæ Saving cart to backend database: { payload }"
   "‚úÖ Cart saved to database"
   ```

3. **Creating Order:**
   ```
   "Order data being sent (with nested lines): { orderData }"
   ```

### Browser DevTools Checks

#### LocalStorage:
- Key: `cartItems`
- Value should include `size` field for items with sizes

#### Network Tab:
- Filter: XHR
- Look for `/api/cart/create`, `/api/cart/update`, `/api/order/create`
- Check request payloads include `size` field

#### Console Errors:
- No "undefined" errors
- No "Cannot read property" errors
- Only expected validation errors

## üöÄ Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] All tests passed
- [ ] No console errors in production build
- [ ] Build completes successfully: `npm run build`
- [ ] Backend is ready to receive size data
- [ ] Database schema supports size field
- [ ] Staging environment tested
- [ ] User acceptance testing completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Team trained on new feature

## üìä Success Metrics

After deployment, monitor:
- [ ] Cart abandonment rate (should not increase)
- [ ] "Add to cart" success rate
- [ ] Size selection completion rate
- [ ] Backend validation error rate
- [ ] User feedback about size selection

## üÜò Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
1. Backend can ignore `size` field (optional)
2. Frontend will continue to work
3. Size selectors will still appear but won't enforce validation
4. Gradual rollout recommended: 10% ‚Üí 50% ‚Üí 100%

## üìù Known Limitations

1. **Multi-Size Products:**
   - Same product with different sizes = separate cart entries
   - This is intentional but may surprise some users

2. **Size Synchronization:**
   - If backend sizes change, user must refresh page
   - Consider implementing real-time size availability

3. **Legacy Products:**
   - Old products without sizes work as before
   - No migration needed

## ‚ú® Future Enhancements

- [ ] Size availability indicator (low stock, out of stock per size)
- [ ] Size guide/chart integration
- [ ] Size recommendation based on age
- [ ] Quick size selection from thumbnail
- [ ] Bulk add (multiple sizes at once)
- [ ] Size filter in product search
